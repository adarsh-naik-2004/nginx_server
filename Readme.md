## Features

- **Load Balancing** (Round Robin, Random, Least Connections)
- **Rate Limiting** with Redis integration
- **Health Checking** of backend services
- **YAML-based Configuration**
- **Cluster Worker Model** for vertical scaling
- **Header Manipulation** capabilities
- **Path-based Routing** rules
- **Multiple Upstream** support

### Requirements
- Node.js 18+ & npm
- Redis 6+ (local or cloud instance)
- Unix-like environment (Windows requires WSL2)

## Installation

1. Clone repository:
```bash
